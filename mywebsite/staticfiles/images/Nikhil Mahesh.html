					<h4>The Spark That Ignited My Passion for Coding and Computer Engineering</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>A few months after writing my first "Hello World" program in the year 2020 (while in school), I found it interesting and was very curious about how all this development works. The lines of code felt like a new languageâ€”a gateway to endless possibilities. I remember spending hours after school, tinkering with my computer, trying to solve small problems, and each successful line of code felt like a small victory. One day, I stumbled upon an online tutorial that guided me through creating a simple webpage made using HTML , CSS and Javascript. The moment I saw my first webpage in action, I was hooked. I realized that coding is not just about writing commands; it's about creating something from nothing, solving problems, and continuously learning. My curiosity soon turned into a full-blown passion, pushing me to dive deeper into computer engineering and explore new programming languages and technologies. This journey from "Hello World" to developing my own projects has been thrilling, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next. </p>

					<p>PS: Not much of an expert yet , still learning  and experimenting with new things. Much more to go ðŸš€ðŸ’¡ </p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer &amp; Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>
					In the short term, I'm all in on mastering the craft of building fullstack projects. My goal is to create applications that genuinely help people and make a difference. I'm also excited to harness the power of AI to boost my efficiency and productivity. This journey isn't just about expanding my technical skills, but about innovating and building solutions that can have a real impact. Every step I take now is paving the way for bigger and better things ahead. ðŸš€ðŸ’¡</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team &amp; learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
